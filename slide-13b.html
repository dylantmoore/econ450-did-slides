          <h3>Lecture Notes: Boning, Hendren, Sprung-Keyser &amp; Stuart (QJE, 2025)</h3>
          <p><strong>Citation:</strong> &ldquo;A Welfare Analysis of Tax Audits Across the Income Distribution,&rdquo; <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em>, Vol.&nbsp;140, Issue&nbsp;1, pp.&nbsp;63&ndash;142.</p>
          <p><strong>The left figure</strong> shows what happens when you study <em>all</em> IRS audits. Operational audits are not randomly assigned&mdash;the IRS targets people who look suspicious. As a result, audited taxpayers had recently experienced an income bump (which likely triggered the audit). This creates a clear pre-trend violation: the treatment group&rsquo;s income was already diverging from the control group before the audit occurred.</p>
          <p><strong>The right figure</strong> uses only the National Research Program (NRP) audits, which <em>are</em> randomly assigned. The NRP selects a stratified random sample of returns for review to estimate the &ldquo;tax gap.&rdquo; With random assignment, there is no reason for treatment and control groups to differ before the audit. Sure enough, the pre-trends are flat near zero.</p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <strong>Key finding:</strong> Audited taxpayers pay about $300 more per year in additional taxes, and this effect persists for at least 14 years with no visible decay. In present value, these deterrence effects raise 3.2&times; as much revenue as the initial audit itself. Returns to audits rise sharply with income: every $1 spent auditing taxpayers above the 90th percentile yields about $12 in revenue.
          </div>
          <p><strong>Why this matters for DID:</strong> The non-random audits would give a misleading picture because selection into treatment is correlated with the outcome trajectory. An earlier study (DeBacker et al., 2018) used NRP data but omitted year-since-audit fixed effects and found a <em>negative</em> deterrence effect for high-income taxpayers&mdash;that result disappears with the correct specification. This illustrates how specification choices in event studies can matter enormously.</p>
