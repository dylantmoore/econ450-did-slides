          Event studies solve this by estimating a <strong>separate effect for each time period</strong> relative to

      <template id="dlg-s15-intuition" data-title="The Simplest Way to Think About Event Studies">
        <p>Here is probably the easiest way to understand what an event study plot shows:</p>
        <ol style="margin:0.5rem 0 0.5rem 1.5rem;">
          <li>Plot the outcome variable for the treatment group over time.</li>
          <li>Plot the outcome variable for the control group over time on the same graph.</li>
          <li><strong>Slide one line up or down</strong> so that the two lines overlap at one point in time (the reference period, usually <em>t</em> = &minus;1).</li>
          <li>The gap between the two lines at every other point in time is what the event study is plotting.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That is it. The event study coefficients are just the difference between the two groups' outcomes after forcing them to overlap at the reference period.</p>
      </template>

      <template id="dlg-s15-prepost" data-title="Pre- vs. Post-Treatment Coefficients">
        <p>The pre-treatment coefficients tell you whether the two groups were on similar trajectories before the policy. The post-treatment coefficients tell you how the groups diverged after the policy&mdash;and those divergences are your estimates of the causal effect (if you trust the parallel trends assumption).</p>
