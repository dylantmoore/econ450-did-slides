        Discussion: Is DID appropriate for this setting?

          <p style="font-size: 0.92rem; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0;">
            Before the layoff, <strong>everyone still had a job</strong>. The world before layoffs tells us nothing about who will struggle to find new work <em>after</em> the layoff.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 0.92rem; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">
            <strong>Think about it:</strong> TAA is given to workers whose layoffs were caused by <em>trade</em>&mdash;imports, offshoring. Program administrators are trying to help workers who they believe will have a <strong>harder time</strong> finding new employment.

          <p style="font-size: 0.92rem; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0;">
            <strong style="color: #0072B2;">The selection story:</strong> If TAA goes to workers expected to have <em>worse</em> trajectories post-layoff, then comparing approved to denied workers &mdash; even with parallel pre-trends &mdash; would <strong>understate</strong> the true benefit of the program.

          <p style="font-size: 0.92rem; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0;">
            <strong style="color: #CC79A7;">Key insight:</strong> Parallel trends in the <em>pre-layoff</em> period doesn't imply parallel <em>counterfactual</em> trends in the post-layoff period. The layoff itself is a <strong>regime change</strong> that reshuffles who's advantaged.

        <p>Imagine two factory workers with identical earnings histories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Worker A:</strong> Worked at a textile mill. Skills are highly specific to that industry. Local area has few alternatives.</li>
          <li><strong>Worker B:</strong> Worked at an electronics plant. Skills transfer to growing sectors. Local tech industry is hiring.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before the layoff, both workers look identical&mdash;same earnings, same trajectory. But after the layoff, Worker A faces a much harder path.</p>
        <p>If the TAA program correctly identifies Worker A as needing help (because their layoff was trade-related), then comparing A to B <em>understates</em> how much TAA helped&mdash;because absent the program, A would have done worse anyway.</p>
        <div class="example-box">
          <strong>The parallel trends assumption fails</strong> not because of anything we can see in the pre-period, but because the <em>post-layoff counterfactual trajectories</em> differ between groups.

      <template id="dlg-s08-implications" data-title="Implications for DID">
        <p><strong>This is a fundamental limitation of DID in certain settings:</strong></p>
        <p>When treatment is assigned based on characteristics that predict <em>post-event outcomes</em> (but not pre-event outcomes), parallel pre-trends tells us nothing.</p>
        <p>In the TAA case:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Treatment (TAA approval) is assigned based on whether the layoff was trade-related</li>
          <li>Trade-related layoffs may predict worse post-layoff outcomes (skills less transferable, local economy more distressed)</li>
          <li>But trade-relatedness doesn't affect pre-layoff earnings&mdash;everyone still had a job!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is why Hyman uses <strong>instrumental variables</strong> (investigator leniency) rather than naive DID. We'll revisit this paper later in the semester when we learn IV methods.</p>
